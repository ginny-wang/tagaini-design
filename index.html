                    <p>Since early 2020, the AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islander) community has borne the brunt of the blame concerning the global pandemic. This has caused an increased number of hate crimes towards the community, often in the form of  <b>abuse and verbal slurs.</b> 

                        <b>Unfortunately, this treatment is anything but new.</b>
                         
                        Racism towards the AAPI community has been around for <b>well over a century.</b> </p>

                    Developing throughout the years, this racism has more recently been influenced by the wrongful portrayal of AAPI in the media. 
                    <br><br />
                    Firstly, there is an extremely limited number of roles available, with Asian-Americans making up only <b>1.4 % of lead characters in studio films.</b>
                    <br><br />
                    This makes little sense taking into consideration the <b>23 million Asian-Americans</b> in the United States, a number which has <b>doubled since 2000</b> and is projected to continue growing at a rapid rate. 
                    Secondly, AAPI are usually <b>absent from the media</b>, but when they do appear, they are usually portrayed as one of the few <b>Hollywood stereotypes</b> for Asian roles.
                    As though members of the AAPI community cannot be seen as more the <b>ragon lady, model minority, or tiger mom. </b>

                <p>This portrayal has had a dangerous effect. What people see in the media heavily impacts their views on both individuals and racial groups as a whole. The AAPI community has suffered far too much from misrepresentation in media.</p>
